# Introduction
This was the final project I submitted for my algorithms class in Fall of 2015. It finds all possible ways to fill a given board with a given set of tiles.

# Sample Inputs/Outputs
For an example of the input this program accepts <a href="/tiling_problem/boards/checkerboard">see here</a>. The input files are hardcoded in. The program sets the largest contiguous area as the board and every other contiguous area as the pieces.

# Algorithm
(note: explain efficiency)
