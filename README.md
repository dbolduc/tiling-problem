# Introduction
This was the final project I submitted for my algorithms class in Fall of 2015. It finds all possible ways to fill a given board with a given set of tiles.

# Sample Inputs/Outputs
For an example <a href="tiling-problem/tiling_problem/boards/checkerboard">See Here </a>

# Algorithm
(note: explain efficiency)
